# blake3batch
OpenCL implementation of batched blake3 calls.

Mostly copy pasted from the reference C implementation, with a lot of debugging (damn there was a lot of debugging). Has decent performance on my GTX 1060, but since I have no real idea how to benchmark it, y'all are just gonna have to try it out and let me know.
